Car Wash Data Analysis - Graph Explanation

1. Social Media Conversion Rate (Pie Chart)
   - This chart helps us measure the effectiveness of social media advertising in driving actual conversions. 
   - We first fix the total number of users from social media at 40. Then, we count how many of these users actually availed the service.
   - The conversion rate is calculated as (Converted Users / Total Users) * 100.
   - A pie chart is used because it visually represents proportions, making it easy to compare the percentage of users who converted versus those who didnâ€™t.
   - The chart uses distinct colors for converted and non-converted users, making it intuitive to understand.

2. Referral Program Effectiveness (Histogram)
   - This visualization analyzes the impact of the referral system by plotting the number of referrals per user.
   - We first calculate the average number of referrals per user to get an overall sense of engagement.
   - Next, we identify the top 5 referrers by sorting customers based on the number of people they referred.
   - A histogram is chosen because it effectively displays frequency distributions, helping us see whether most customers refer just a few people or if a small group refers significantly more.
   - The histogram uses a smooth density curve (kde=True) to highlight trends in referral behavior.

3. Who Recommended This? (Bar Chart)
   - This chart breaks down which sources are responsible for bringing in the most customers.
   - We count the number of customers coming from each referral source (e.g., Social Media, Friends, Ads).
   - A bar chart is used as it is ideal for comparing categorical data, allowing us to quickly see which referral source is most effective.
   - The bars are color-coded to improve readability, and gridlines are added to enhance clarity.
   - This helps businesses decide which marketing channels are most effective and where to invest more effort.

Together, these graphs provide valuable insights into customer acquisition, conversion rates, and the impact of referrals, helping businesses make data-driven marketing decisions.
